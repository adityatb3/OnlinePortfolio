            This website is a space where you can learn more about who I am: my goals, interests, hobbies, and aspirations for the future. A few of my favorite pastimes include programming, playing video games and basketball, spending time with friends, and constantly exploring new skills and technologies. Academically, I’m working toward earning a degree in Computer Science from UCLA. My long-term career goal is to become a cybersecurity analyst and eventually launch my own tech business. My passion for cybersecurity has grown steadily over the years. What started as a curiosity about how systems work and how they can be broken evolved into a deep interest in protecting digital environments. From experimenting with basic encryption, learning about real-world cyber threats, or understanding how networks are secured, each step has solidified my desire to pursue cybersecurity as a career.
